Hi, I'm Mohammad Zafari ðŸ‘‹I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Kharazmi University (GPA 3.9/4.0), passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and building efficient, intelligent systems. I enjoy tackling complex problems and am always eager to learn new technologies.ðŸš€ Core SkillsLanguages: Python, Java, C, SQL, MATLABFrameworks: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCVAreas of Interest: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Knowledge Distillation, Data Science, Algorithm DesignðŸ’» Selected ProjectsHere are a few of the projects I'm most proud of. You can find more in my repositories!Knowledge Distillation for Image ClassificationMy senior project, where I used PyTorch to develop a framework that helps small, efficient AI models learn from larger ones, improving their accuracy on image classification tasks.Clustering Algorithms ComparisonImplemented and compared K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN to understand their strengths and weaknesses on different types of data.Digit Recognition with MNISTBuilt and trained neural networks using both Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits.15-Puzzle SolverWrote a program that solves the classic 15-puzzle game using smart search algorithms like A* and Hill-Climbing.ðŸ“« Get In TouchEmail: mhdzafari80@gmail.comPortfolio Website: m-zafari.github.io
